JavaScript application, fetching data from fixer.io. This application will allow the user to: 
* select a base currency (A) 
* select a target currency (B) 
* input an amount currency A 
* get the current value converted in currency B 
* get the calculated tendency (Â±%) over the past 30 days 
* see a graph plotting the evolution of the converted value over the past 30 days 

Scalability: 
Although you do not have to develop them, your design choices should reflect the possibilities to add features in a version 2. 
Some (cool) features to take into account that could potentially be added later: 
* Possibility to select a date range, adapt the tendency and the chart accordingly. 
* Possibility to convert to cryptocurrencies to the deal (with another API?). 
* Possibility to have a wallet of multiple amounts of currencies, plot their value in currency B altogether. * * Highlight the date where this wallet had the optimal value. 

Requirements: 
* The interface must be good looking and user friendly, make an interface you would love to use. You can use a view library. 
* You are free to use the JavaScript framework you prefer (or none). 
* Other than that, you must use as few dependencies as possible, justify the one you are using. 
* Even though the additional features are NOT to be developed, your design choices should reflect the possibility to develop them in a version 2.
